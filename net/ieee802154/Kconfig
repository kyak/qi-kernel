	  IEEE Std 802.15.4 defines a low data rate, low power and low
	  complexity short range wireless personal area networks. It was
	  designed to organise networks of sensors, switches, etc automation
	  devices. Maximum allowed data rate is 250 kb/s and typical personal
	  operating space around 10m.
